# 2022 BU Summer School Differential Privacy Material

This is the material from my presenttion at the BU summer school
on differential privacy in the summer of 2022. 
https://bostondataprivacy.github.io/summerschool/
It consists of my slides and two jupyter notebooks, one covering
privacy semantics and the other utility. The notebooks are best
used inside a Google Collab environment because they cache data
on google drive to avoid recomputation.

The privacy semantics notebook is particularly useful for people
getting into the mathematics of privacy, as it uses simulations to
show the privacy loss random variables and the associated hypothesis
testing semantics of DP.

This material is free to use for academic and educational purposes, 
just make sure to cite the source.
